The associated script contains the function run_analysis() that will load data collected from the Samsung Galaxy S smart phone accelerometers. This function requires the working directory to include the raw data from Samsung, downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
This function also requires the reshape2 package to be installed. Please install using install.packages("reshape2") if you have not previously done so.
